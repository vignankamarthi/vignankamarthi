## Vignan Kamarthi

AI/ML Research Engineer | Embedded Systems Engineer @ Boston Engineering

I build production AI systems across the full stack—from low-level embedded code to high-level intelligent behavior. My work spans multi-agent orchestration, ensemble learning, and knowledge-augmented generation.

Published at **ACM ICMI 2025** with research on multimodal pain classification using physiological signals.

### Recent Work

**Multi-Agent AI Systems**: Production-grade LangGraph orchestration with hybrid database architecture (MySQL + Neo4j + FAISS) for intelligent query routing and collaborative filtering

**Multimodal ML Research**: Ensemble learning achieving 1.0 binary accuracy on pain classification from physiological signals (EDA, BVP, RESP) using Catch22 feature extraction

**Embedded Systems Engineering**: Zephyr RTOS hardware migration, static analysis integration, and acoustic communications at Boston Engineering

### Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python, C/C++, Rust, TypeScript, SQL  
**AI/ML**: PyTorch, LangGraph, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face, FAISS  
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Neo4j, MySQL, Git, CI/CD, Zephyr RTOS  
**Frontend**: React, Node.js, Streamlit
